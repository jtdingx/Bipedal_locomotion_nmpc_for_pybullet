# locomotion_nmpc_pybullet

The nmpc-based gait planning and control, which is based on Ding, Jiatao, et al. "Nonlinear model predictive control for robust bipedal locomotion exploring com height and angular momentum changes." arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.06770 (2019).
This version provide two novelties: 1) is to take the CoM acceleration as the control input, 2) soft ZMP contrains are employed. 

Using cmake--/make tool, the .exe file is builed which can be used by python codes.
